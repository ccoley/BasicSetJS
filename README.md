# SetJS

A basic implementation of the `Set` data structure in Javascript. In case you
don't know what a [set][1] is, I'll quote Wikipedia.

> A set is an abstract data structure that can store certain values, without any particular order, and no repeated values.

The `BasicSet` in SetJS supports values of type `Numeric` or `String`.
